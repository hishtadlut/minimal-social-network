# Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying the Minimal Social Network application to a production environment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- A server or cloud instance with sufficient resources
- Domain name (optional, but recommended)
- SSL certificate (optional, but recommended for production)

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository on your production server:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimal-social-network.git
   cd minimal-social-network
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store environment variables:
   ```
   touch .env
   ```

3. Add the following variables to the `.env` file, replacing the values with your production settings:
   ```
   DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_db_password
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   DOMAIN_NAME=your_domain.com
   ```

4. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to use production settings:
   - Remove or comment out the volume mapping for the database service
   - Update the environment variables to use the values from the `.env` file
   - Add a reverse proxy service (e.g., Traefik or Nginx) for SSL termination

5. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
   ```

6. Set up a reverse proxy and SSL:
   - If using Traefik, configure it to handle SSL termination and routing
   - If using Nginx, set up a separate Nginx container or host installation to handle SSL and proxy requests to your services

7. Set up database backups:
   - Create a backup script that dumps the PostgreSQL database regularly
   - Store backups securely, preferably off-site or in a separate cloud storage

8. Monitor your application:
   - Set up logging for all services (e.g., using ELK stack or a cloud-based logging service)
   - Implement application performance monitoring (APM) tools

9. Set up Continuous Deployment (optional):
   - Configure your CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes to your production environment after successful tests

## Security Considerations

1. Keep all software updated, including Docker, Docker Compose, and base images
2. Use strong, unique passwords for all services
3. Implement rate limiting on your API to prevent abuse
4. Regularly audit and rotate access keys and secrets
5. Enable and configure a firewall on your production server
6. Implement proper user authentication and authorization in your application

## Scaling

As your user base grows, consider the following scaling strategies:

1. Implement caching using Redis or Memcached
2. Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances
3. Implement database read replicas to handle increased read traffic
4. Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets

## Troubleshooting

1. Check container logs:
   ```
   docker-compose logs [service_name]
   ```

2. Verify that all services are running:
   ```
   docker-compose ps
   ```

3. Check the application logs for any error messages or warnings

4. Ensure that all required ports are open and accessible

5. Verify that environment variables are correctly set and loaded

Remember to always test your deployment process in a staging environment before applying changes to production. Regularly review and update your deployment process to incorporate best practices and new technologies.
